An alternative of [RFC Viewer](www.effetech.com/rfc), free and open source.

It is a legacy tool I developed when I read RFC files several years ago.   
Now you can use [http://www.rfcreader.com/](http://www.rfcreader.com/), which is powerful and cool. But you can still use FreeRFCView for offline usage.
